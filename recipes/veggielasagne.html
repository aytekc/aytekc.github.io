        <FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2><P>Neriman&#146;s Vegetarian Lasagne</P>
        2 T olive oil<br>
        3 medium sized onions<br>
        1 bell pepper<br>
        1 pack (12 oz) mushrooms<br>
        2 C broccoli<br>
        2 C squash<br>
        <br>
        1 package lasagne (ready to bake preferred, at least 9 strips -- 8 oz pack)<br>
        <br>
        1 small container ricotta cheese (15 oz)<br>
        3/4 lb. shredded mozarella cheese<br>
        1/2 C shredded parmesan cheese<br>
        <br>
        dry oregano<br>
        dry basil<br>
        fresh garlic<br>
        1/4 C olive oil<br>
        1 large can peeled tomatoes (28 oz) (blend in food processor)<br>
        salt<br>
        pepper<br>
        <br>
        <P>Chop all of the vegetables into good size chunks.  Sautee onions in a little olive oil (add a little salt).  Add bell peppers and the stems of the broccoli.  Stir and cook for a few minutes (cover).  Add mushrooms and squash, stir and cook for a few more minutes (cover).  Add broccoli florettes and sprinkle salt, pepper, oregano and basil on top, and then cook for 20 minute&#0;&#3;&quot;s.  Set aside.</P>
        <P>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.</P>
        <P>In another pan, turn on the heat to medium.  First add basil and oregano.  Then, 30 seconds later, add the olive oil  and garlic.  Stir gently for a few seconds and then pour blended tomatoes into the pan.  Add salt and pepper.  Let it simmer on low for 10 minutes.  Set aside so it stays warm.</P>
        <P>In large rectangular pan (about 8&quot;x12&quot;), spread thin layer of cooked veggies and just a little bit of the mozarella cheese.  Place 3 strips of lasagne (do not overlap or let them touch the edges of the pan) into the pan.  Cover them with a layer of the cooked vegetables.  Then spoon and fork out little bits of ricotta cheese, distributing the spots evenly over the vegetables.  Generously spread 1/3 the mozarella cheese.  Then spread a small handfu&#0;Xl  (1/3) of the shredded parmesan cheese.  Repeat the layering (starting from the lasagne strips) two more times.</P>
        <P>Pour the tomatoe sauce (beginning with the center) into the lasagne pan.  Spread it onto the sides of the pan, if necessary.  Place 10 toothpicks evenly around the pan, so that they stick up.  Cover the pan with aluminum foil so that the foil rests on the toothpicks, and does not touch the tomatoe sauce.</P>
        <P>Bake for 45 minutes covered with the foil.  Remove foil and then bake for 10 more minutes.    Remove from the oven and serve!  Sprinkle with shredded parmesan cheese if desired.&#0;</P></FONT></BODY>
