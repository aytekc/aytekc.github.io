        1.5 C powdered sugar<br>
        1 C butter at room temperature (soft)<br>
        1 t vanilla<br>
        3 C flour (add slowly after 2.5 C.... if necesary)<br>
        <P>Preheat oven to 300 degrees.</P>
        <P>Mix 1 C powdered sugar, butter and vanilla by hand on a smooth surface (or in food processor).  Knead for 3-4 minutes (if without food processor).</P>
        <P>Add two cups flour into the food processor.  Take it out and put it into big bowl and knead it by hand and then keep adding the remaining flour slowly.  It will start leaving the side of the bowl (and your hands) clean.  Knead for about 10 minutes or so.  Gather the dough into a ball.  Then make little balls, and flatten with your hand.   Place on cookie sheet.</P>
        <P>Bake cookies for 15-20 minutes.  Cookies should be slightly pink underneath.  Sprinkle the top of the cookies with the rest of the powdered sugar.</P></FONT></BODY>
