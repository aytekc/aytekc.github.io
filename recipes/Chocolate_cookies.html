        <P>Chocolate cookies!  (via my folks and tv) </P>
        Ingredients:<br>
        1 C Flour<br>
        1/2 C Cocoa powder<br>
        2 t baking powder<br>
        1/8 t salt<br>
        stick unsalted butter (let soften in pieces at room temperature)<br>
        1 t vanilla extract<br>
        1 C brown sugar<br>
        2 eggs<br>
        1/2 cup melted chocolate (ghiradelli bars or other chocolate chips)<br>
        3 sheets plastic wrap<br>
        powdered sugar<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Place the dry ingredients into a bowl:<br>
        <br>
        1 C Flour<br>
        1/2 C Cocoa powder<br>
        2 t baking powder<br>
        1/8 t salt<br>
        <br>
        <P>Mix well and set aside.<br>
            <br>
        In another bowl:</P>
        1 stick unsalted butter (let soften in pieces at room temperature)<br>
        1 t vanilla extract<br>
        1 C brown sugar<br>
        <P>Beat butter, vanilla &amp; sugar. Mix until creamy. </P>
        <P>Add 2 eggs and keep beating.</P>
        <P>Add 1/2 cup melted chocolate to the mix.  Beat into the mixture.  </P>
        <P>Then with wooden spoon, gently stir in dry ingredients.  It should be soft -- like a brownie mix.</P>
        <P>Set out 3 sheets of plastic wrap.  Put 1/3 of mix onto one end of each sheet.  Then wrap each sheet into a cylinder and place into the refridgerator for 45-60 minutes.  They should be hard.</P>
        <P>When you remove them from the fridge, unroll gently and dust them all over with powdered sugar -- and then roll them back up again (in the same sheets of plastic wrap) for at least another 30-45 minutes in the fridge.</P>
        <P>Preheat oven to 350.</P>
        <P>Remove from the fridge and unwrap rolls.  Cut them (one at a time) into 1/2&quot; rings and roll each ring by hand, (dip into powdered sugar so they won&#146;t stick) press just a little and then place them on baking sheet.  Bake at 350 for 10-12 minutes.  They should be soft.  Let them cool and enjoy!</P>
